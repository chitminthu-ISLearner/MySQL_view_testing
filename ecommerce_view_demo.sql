WHERE status='Completed';

-- Q3. Create a JOIN VIEW for order details (customer + product)

CREATE VIEW order_details AS
SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name, p.product_name, oi.quantity
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id;

CREATE VIEW order_sales AS
SELECT o.order_id, SUM(p.price * oi.quantity) AS total_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY o.order_id;

-- Q5. Create a VIEW for high-value orders (above 1,000,000)

CREATE VIEW high_value_orders AS
SELECT o.order_id, SUM(p.price * oi.quantity) AS total_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
